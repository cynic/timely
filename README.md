# Development

Run `mix phx.server`.  Elm will be compiled to JS when it can be.

Adding a new data structure on the DB side?  Use `mix phx.gen.context`; see [Phx.Mix.Gen](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/1.7.11/Mix.Tasks.Phx.Gen.html).  Examples:

- `mix phx.gen.context Data Task tasks text:string status:enum:active:complete:ignored`

# Testing

Within `assets/frontend`, run:
- `mocha tests/awesomebar.spec.js`
- `npx elm-test`

# Database

```

Table timely.task {
  id int [pk]
  // within text, we can have:
  // - description
  // - duration
  // - when
  text string

}

Table timely.comments {
  id int [pk]
  task_id int
  text string
  created_at datetime
  comment_reason timely.comment_reason
}

// Creating references
// You can also define relaionship separately
// > many-to-one; < one-to-many; - one-to-one; <> many-to-many
Ref: timely.task.id < timely.comments.task_id
